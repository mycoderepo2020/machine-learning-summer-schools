This means we have no stochasticity due to realization of the sample and any policy $\\pi$ should have the same estimator of averaged reward.\n",

If you want to be close to the reality (and do more sophisticated experiments), it is better to simulate a dataset $S=\\{context_t, action_t, propensity_t, reward_t\\}$ and then write the IPS estimation rather than rely on mathematical properties of our minimalist system. Also remark than in real system this is a good idea to also store the possible set of actions at each timestep. What do you think of this estimator while you can sample $S$ only one time ? \n",

Build several estimates of the policy selecting always arm 2. How many samples do you need to identify with confidence that this policy is better than the logging policy ? \n"
